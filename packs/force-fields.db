It has saved the lives of Acolyte warbands and beleaguered teams of Adeptus Arbites on many worlds across Askellon. The wall consists of two or more generators. Activating or deactivating a generator requires a Full Action, which also activates all other linked generators. A linear force ield then forms between each generator, 1.5 metres high and up to 8 metres in length. The barrier acts as cover, so only parts of the body protected by the ield wall gain force ield protection. If a wall section overloads, then only that portion between the two generators shuts down, and any other linked sections remain unafected.</p>","availability":"very-rare","weight":18,"protectionRating":65,"overloadChance":10},"flags":{},"img":"modules/dh2e_resources/icons/ForceFields/aura.svg","effects":[],"_id":"5FM67q7SnEOQ3faY"}

They operate not by absorbing or shunting away an attack&rsquo;s energy, but instead by shifting the user away using miniature Warp-jump technologies.

Each activation carries the supreme risk of unprotected travel through the Empyrean; even as the body is swept to safety, the soul risks damnation. When the field successfully nullifies an attack, the user jumps in a random direction using the Scatter Diagram on page 230. Roll 3d10 for the number of metres travelled&mdash;the wearer always emerges on solid footing and in a suitable empty space.
